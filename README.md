Important compile and run instructions
gcc –m32 –O0 –s fileName.c >> is used to convert the instructions on fileName.c file into a level zero fileName.s assembly file 

gcc –m32 –O1 –S fileName.c >> is used to convert the instructions on fileName.c file into a level one fileName.s assembly file

NOTE that comments are not converted from C to assembly 

gcc –m32 –o fileName fileName.s >> Links fileName to its old fileName in case it have been edited

objdump –d fileName >> runs the machine code using command line

gcc –m32 –o fileName fileName.s >> Compiles .s files which can then be run independently

All fileName.c files were added for the purpose of testing
